# My Chaotic Coding Style

I usually start by asking **ChatGPT** to write me a python script to pull data from an API. 

I copy paste it into **VS Code**. If it doesn't work, I copy the error message back to ChatGPT and ask it to fix it. I keep doing this until it works. 

Sometimes I use **GitHub Copilot** to help me write functions. 

I don't really use version control until the end when I just commit everything. 

I debug with print statements. I never write tests first.
