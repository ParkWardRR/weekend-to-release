# Claire's Methodical Workflow

I start by writing a spec in Jira. Then I move to VS Code.

I write a failing test first (Red).
Then I implement the minimal code to pass (Green).
Then I refactor (Blue).

I use Jest for testing and specific linters like ESLint.
I commit frequently with conventional commits.
