# Contributing Your Knowledge

Drop any `.md` files into your folder. No structure required — just write what you know.

## How it works

1. Create a folder: `contributors/your-name/`
2. Write `.md` files with your thoughts, tips, workflows, war stories, whatever
3. Run `npm run generate:curriculum`
4. Your content becomes a structured course at the site

## What to write about

Anything useful. Examples:
- How you debug things
- Your deployment process
- Tools you swear by
- Mistakes you've made
- Shortcuts that save you time
- How you think about architecture
- Your testing approach

Write messy. The pipeline handles the formatting.
