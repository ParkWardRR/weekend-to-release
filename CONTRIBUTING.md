# Contributing to Weekend-to-Release

Thanks for your interest in improving this curriculum! This project is a static educational repo (Markdown + Mermaid diagrams, no code), so contributing is straightforward.

## How to Contribute

### Fixing typos or broken links

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch from `main`.
3. Make your fix.
4. Open a pull request with a short description of what you changed.

### Suggesting new content or improvements

1. Open an issue describing the improvement or new topic.
2. Wait for feedback from a maintainer before investing time in a large change.
3. Once approved, follow the fork-and-PR workflow above.

### Adding or updating Mermaid diagrams

- Use `flowchart TD` or `flowchart LR` for most diagrams.
- Keep diagrams simple: aim for 6-12 nodes.
- Test that your diagram renders on GitHub by previewing the Markdown file.

## Writing Style

This project targets an **ELI-15** audience. When writing:

- Use short sentences. Define jargon the first time it appears.
- Prefer "why this matters" followed by "do this now."
- Avoid walls of text; use headings, lists, and diagrams.
- Every module should end with a checklist.

## What We're Looking For

- Clearer explanations of existing topics.
- Better real-world examples.
- Diagram improvements.
- Typo and grammar fixes.
- Translations (open an issue first to coordinate).

## What We're Not Looking For

- Executable code or scripts (this repo is documentation only).
- Content that assumes deep programming knowledge.
- Enterprise-scale tooling or platform-specific guides.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single change.
- Write a clear title and description.
- Reference any related issue (e.g., `Fixes #12`).
