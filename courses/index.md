# Learn from the Pros

Each contributor shares their real workflow, tips, and hard-won knowledge. The pipeline turns their raw notes into structured learning materials.

## Contributors

- [Ai Example 1](./ai_example_1/) — AI Agent Beta: The Rapid Prototyper
- [Ai Example 2](./ai_example_2/) — AI Agent Alpha: The Methodical One
- [Alex](./alex/) — My Chaotic Coding Style
- [Antigravity](./antigravity/) — My Agentic Coding Style
- [Claire](./claire/) — Claire's Methodical Workflow

## How This Works

1. Experienced developers write messy `.md` files in `contributors/their-name/`
2. `npm run generate:curriculum` turns those into structured courses
3. Each contributor gets a curriculum overview, full course, and cheatsheet
4. A reviewer polishes the output before it goes live
