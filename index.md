## Who This Is For

- **The AI-Curious Builder** — You can chat with an LLM, but you want to build *systems* that other people can install and use.
- **The Non-SWE Founder** — You want to leverage AI to ship real products without a decade of engineering experience.
- **The Pro** — You want to learn the specific patterns of agentic software development.

## The Curriculum

### Phase 1: From Blank Page to "It Runs"

![Phase 1 AI Brain](/images/phase_1_brain.png)

*Learn to wield the agentic stack to generate code that actually works.*

| Module | Topic | What You'll Learn |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skill 01 | [The AI Stack](/curriculum/ai_skills/01_the_ai_stack) | Set up your agentic workflow — the brains, the hands, the eyes. |
| Skill 02 | [The Perfect Spec](/curriculum/ai_skills/02_prompt_engineering) | Write prompts that generate working code on the first try. |
| Skill 03 | [The Build Loop](/curriculum/ai_skills/03_agentic_workflow) | The Red/Green/Review process for iterating from broken to running. |
| Skill 04 | [Context Mastery](/curriculum/ai_skills/04_context_management) | Manage heavy files and token limits in large projects. |
| Skill 05 | [AI Debugging](/curriculum/ai_skills/05_debugging_collaboratively) | Fix bugs without hallucinating more bugs. |

### Phase 2: The Idea Filter

*Before you prompt, decide what is worth building.*

| Module | Topic | What You'll Learn |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Module A | [The Idea Filter](/curriculum/01_idea_filter) | Go from "cool demo" to shippable product brief. |
| Module B | [The MVP Scope](/curriculum/02_mvp_scope) | Define the smallest installable value and cut everything else. |

### Phase 3: From "It Runs" to "It Ships"

![Phase 3 Ship](/images/phase_3_ship.png)

*The release engineering that turns a project into a product.*

| Module | Topic | What You'll Learn |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Module C | [Distribution & Install](/curriculum/03_distribution) | Create a foolproof install path anyone can follow. |
| Module D | [Config & Safety](/curriculum/04_config_safety) | Handle user settings and secrets without exposing them. |
| Module E | [Testing Strategy](/curriculum/05_testing) | Verify your release without writing a massive test suite. |
| Module F | [Versioning & Upgrades](/curriculum/06_versioning) | Semantic versioning, changelogs, and upgrade paths. |
| Module G | [Support Loop](/curriculum/07_support_loop) | Manage issues and feedback without burnout. |
| Module H | [Launch & Roadmap](/curriculum/08_launch_feedback) | Ship, gather feedback, and plan the next version. |
