## 📖 About This Repo

**Weekend-to-Release** is a comprehensive curriculum that covers the **entire lifecycle** of software creation using AI Agents:

1.  **Idea ➡️ "It Runs"**: How to use AI Agents to turn a vague thought into working, functional code.
2.  **"It Runs" ➡️ "It Ships"**: How to take that working code and apply the rigorous "boring stuff" (packaging, docs, versioning) that turns it into a real product.

### The Problem
Most creators get stuck in two places:
1.  **The "Blank Page" Paralysis:** They have an idea but don't know how to prompt an AI to generate the *initial* working codebase ("It doesn't run").
2.  **The "Prototype" Trap:** They have a script that works, but it's fragile, undocumented, and impossible for others to install ("It doesn't ship").

### The Solution
We provide a complete framework for both.
*   **Phase 1** teaches you the **Agentic Skills** to generate working code from scratch.
*   **Phase 2 & 3** teach you the **Engineering Discipline** to package, release, and support it.

> **💡 Quick Start:** Check out the **[2-Page Visual Cheatsheet (AI Edition)](./CHEATSHEET.md)** for the high-level roadmap.

## 🎯 The Curriculum

### Phase 1: From Blank Page to "It Runs"
*Learn to wield the agentic stack to generate code that actually works.*

| Module | Topic | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Skill 01](./curriculum/ai_skills/01_the_ai_stack.md)** | **The AI Stack** | Setup your agentic workflow in your preferred environment. |
| **[Skill 02](./curriculum/ai_skills/02_prompt_engineering.md)** | **The Perfect Spec** | Write prompts that generate working code on the first try. |
| **[Skill 03](./curriculum/ai_skills/03_agentic_workflow.md)** | **The Build Loop** | The process of iterating from "broken" to "running" code. |
| **[Skill 04](./curriculum/ai_skills/04_context_management.md)** | **Context Mastery** | Managing heavy files and token limits in large projects. |
| **[Skill 05](./curriculum/ai_skills/05_debugging_collaboratively.md)** | **AI Debugging** | How to fix bugs without hallucinating more bugs. |

### Phase 2: The Idea Filter (What to Build)
*Before you prompt, you must decide what is worth building.*

| Module | Topic | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Module A](./curriculum/01_idea_filter.md)** | **The Idea Filter** | Go from "cool demo" to "shippable product brief". |
| **[Module B](./curriculum/02_mvp_scope.md)** | **The MVP Scope** | Define the smallest installable value and cut everything else. |

### Phase 3: From "It Runs" to "It Ships"
*The release engineering that turns a project into a product.*

| Module | Topic | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Module C](./curriculum/03_distribution.md)** | **Distribution & Install** | Create a foolproof install path anyone can follow. |
| **[Module D](./curriculum/04_config_safety.md)** | **Config & Safety** | Handle user settings and secrets without exposing them. |
| **[Module E](./curriculum/05_testing.md)** | **Testing Strategy** | Verify your release without writing a massive test suite. |
| **[Module F](./curriculum/06_versioning.md)** | **Versioning & Upgrades** | Semantic versioning, changelogs, and upgrade paths. |
| **[Module G](./curriculum/07_support_loop.md)** | **Support Loop** | Manage issues and feedback without burnout. |
| **[Module H](./curriculum/08_launch_feedback.md)** | **Launch & Roadmap** | Ship, gather feedback, and plan the next version. |

## 🛠️ The Agentic Stack

We build using the tools that fit *your* workflow (OS Agnostic):

- **The Brains:** Your preferred LLM (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4).
- **The Hands:** Your Terminal Agent (Antigravity, claude.code, or custom tools).
- **The Eyes:** Your Editor (VS Code, Cursor, Zed).
- **The Deployment:** Your Ops Pipeline (GitHub Actions, Vercel, Netlify).

## 🌐 Web Generation Pipeline (Local CI/CD)
This curriculum can be built into a high-performance static website (VitePress) for better reading.

- **Pipeline Docs:** [Read docs/PIPELINE.md](./docs/PIPELINE.md)
- **Run Locally:** `./tools/pipeline.sh`
- **Developing Site:** [http://localhost:5173/weekend-to-release/](http://localhost:5173/weekend-to-release/)
- **Output:** A deployable `dist` folder you can host anywhere (Netlify, Vercel, S3) without paying for GitHub Enterprise.

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- **The AI-Curious Builder:** You know how to chat with ChatGPT, but struggle to build *systems*.
- **The Non-SWE Founder:** You want to leverage AI to become a 10x engineer without 10 years of experience.
- **The Pro:** You want to learn the specific patterns of *Agentic* software development on any platform.
