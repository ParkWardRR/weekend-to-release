## 📖 About This Repo

**Weekend-to-Release** is a dual-track curriculum:
1.  **Magical Construction (80%)**: How to use AI Agents (`claude.code`, Google Antigravity) to build complex software without getting stuck.
2.  **Professional Release (20%)**: The rigorous "boring stuff" (packaging, docs, versioning) that turns a hacky script into a real product.

### The Problem
Most AI-generated code stays in the chat window. It's often buggy, unmaintainable, or "works on my machine" only.

### The Solution
We treat the AI as a **Junior Developer** and you as the **Engineering Manager**. You provide the Spec, the Review, and the Release Process. The AI writes the code.

> **💡 Quick Start:** Check out the **[2-Page Visual Cheatsheet (AI Edition)](./CHEATSHEET.md)** for the high-level roadmap.

## 🎯 The Curriculum

### Phase 1: The AI Developer (The "80%" Skills)
*Learn to wield the new stack. Development is no longer just typing code.*

| Module | Topic | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Skill 01](./curriculum/ai_skills/01_the_ai_stack.md)** | **The AI Stack** | Setup `claude.code`, Antigravity, and your environment. |
| **[Skill 02](./curriculum/ai_skills/02_prompt_engineering.md)** | **The Perfect Spec** | Write prompts that generate working code on the first try. |
| **[Skill 03](./curriculum/ai_skills/03_agentic_workflow.md)** | **The Build Loop** | The "Spec → Agent → Review" cycle replacing Red/Green/Refactor. |
| **[Skill 04](./curriculum/ai_skills/04_context_management.md)** | **Context Mastery** | Managing heavy files and token limits in large projects. |
| **[Skill 05](./curriculum/ai_skills/05_debugging_collaboratively.md)** | **AI Debugging** | How to fix bugs without hallucinating more bugs. |

### Phase 2: The Foundation (What to Build)
*Before you prompt, you must decide what is worth building.*

| Module | Topic | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Module A](./curriculum/01_idea_filter.md)** | **The Idea Filter** | Go from "cool demo" to "shippable product brief". |
| **[Module B](./curriculum/02_mvp_scope.md)** | **The MVP Scope** | Define the smallest installable value and cut everything else. |

### Phase 3: The Release Engineer (The "20%" Polish)
*The stuff AI often forgets, but users demand.*

| Module | Topic | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Module C](./curriculum/03_distribution.md)** | **Distribution & Install** | Create a foolproof install path anyone can follow. |
| **[Module D](./curriculum/04_config_safety.md)** | **Config & Safety** | Handle user settings and secrets without exposing them. |
| **[Module E](./curriculum/05_testing.md)** | **Testing Strategy** | Verify your release without writing a massive test suite. |
| **[Module F](./curriculum/06_versioning.md)** | **Versioning & Upgrades** | Semantic versioning, changelogs, and upgrade paths. |
| **[Module G](./curriculum/07_support_loop.md)** | **Support Loop** | Manage issues and feedback without burnout. |
| **[Module H](./curriculum/08_launch_feedback.md)** | **Launch & Roadmap** | Ship, gather feedback, and plan the next version. |

## 🛠️ The New Stack

We build using the **Agentic Stack**:

- **Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet / Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (The Brains)
- **Agent CLI:** `claude.code` / Antigravity Terminal (The Hands)
- **IDE:** VS Code / Cursor (The Eyes)
- **Ops:** GitHub + Actions (The Deployment)

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- **The AI-Curious Builder:** You know how to chat with ChatGPT, but struggle to build *systems*.
- **The Non-SWE Founder:** You want to leverage AI to become a 10x engineer without 10 years of experience.
- ** The Pro:** You want to learn the specific patterns of *Agentic* software development.
