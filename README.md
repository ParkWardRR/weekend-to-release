## 📖 About This Repo

**Weekend-to-Release** is a practical, ELI-15 guide to turning a "weekend idea" into a real, professional release.

If you've ever built a cool script or app but stalled on packaging, documentation, versioning, or support, this course is for you. We focus on the **boring-but-critical** parts that make shipping possible:

- ✅ **Scope & MVP Definition**
- 📦 **Packaging & Installation**
- ⚙️ **Configuration & Secrets**
- 🧪 **Testing without Tears**
- 🏷️ **Versioning & Changelogs**
- 🛡️ **Support & Maintenance**

> **💡 Quick Start:** Check out the **[2-Page Visual Cheatsheet](../CHEATSHEET.md)** for the high-level roadmap.

This repo itself is the course. You don't need to sign up anywhere. Just clone it, read the modules, and follow the checklists.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

This course uses simple, standard tools. You won't lock yourself into a proprietary platform.

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- **The Curious Builder:** You can hack together a prototype but get stuck making it "real".
